We just published a security update to the stable version 1.0.
Beside a recently reported Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability,
this release also contains some bug fixes and improvements we
found important for the long term support branch of Roundcube.

It's considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations
of Roundcube with this version. Download it from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download),
see the full changelog [here](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog#RELEASE1.0.5).

Please do backup before updating!
