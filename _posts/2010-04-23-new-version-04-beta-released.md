A new major release is now available for deep testing. With this version we fixed over 50 bugs and added new features like threaded message listing and contact groups support as well as many little improvements that make e-mail reading with Roundcube an even better experience.

While it's still called a beta release we consider it to be stable enough for

productive environments. However the new features may have some minor issues which we are happy to hear about.
