As you might have heard, also the developers of Roundcube are just human beings and thus not always creating perfect and 100% bug free work. The last 0.4.1 release fixed many bugs but also introduced a quite annoying new one. That's why the next release follows just one week later. It fixes a few important bugs, especially the "Server Error" message when expanding/collapsing folders and it also updates some previously incomplete localization files.

Please replace your 0.4.1 or even 0.4 installations with this version. It can be downloaded from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download). We also provide a patch for those who have local modifications and don't want to replace all files again: [sourceforge.net/projects/roundcubemail/files](https://sourceforge.net/projects/roundcubemail/files/).
