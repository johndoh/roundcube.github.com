We just published the feature-complete release candidate for the upcoming 
version 1.0. After adding some new features in 1.0-beta we further cleaned up
the code, fixed some more bugs and prepared everything for the long awaited 
major release.

So we invite all early adopters to test this release candidate and report 
remaining bugs to our bug tracker.

and download the new packages from  [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download).
