We're proud to announce the next service release to the stable version 1.0.
It contains a security fix along with some bug fixes and improvements for
the long term support branch of Roundcube. The most important ones are:

* **Security**: Fix possible CSRF attacks to some address book operations
  as well as to the ACL and Managesieve plugins.
* Fix attachments encoded in TNEF containers (from Outlook)
* Fix compatibility with PHP 5.2

It's considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations
of Roundcube with this version. Download it from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download),
see the full changelog [here](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog).

Please do backup before updating!
