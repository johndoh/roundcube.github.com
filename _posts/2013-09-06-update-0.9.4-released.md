title: Update 0.9.4 released
tags: releases updates

It wouldn't be Roundcube if there wasn't a minor glitch in our stable releases 
every now and then. It so happened again in the recent 0.9.3 release where an 
include_path check triggered some regex warnings on Windows systems. 
We apologize for this! But we're trying hard to keep up and here's a new 
release which fixes that nasty bug together with some other reported issues 
that we considered worth being ported to the 0.9 release series.

It's considered stable (really!) and we recommend to update all productive 
installations of Roundcube with this version. Download it from 
[roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download), see the full changelog 
[here](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog).
