We proudly announce the beta release of the next major version 1.4 of Roundcube webmail.
With this milestone we introduce some new features:

* New responsive skin with mobile support
* Email Resent (Bounce) feature
* Improved Mailvelope integration
* Support for Redis cache
* Support for SMTPUTF8

Because the new responsive skin is not yet fully completed, it's not enabled
by default. In order to make it the default for your users, change your
`config.inc.php` accordingly:

    $config['skin'] = 'elastic';

Although it still needs some polishing, the new skin solves the urgent need
to enable access to Roundcube for mobile devices. The plugin [elastic4mobile](https://plugins.roundcube.net/packages/roundcube/elastic4mobile)
makes it the default for mobile devices while keeping the configured default
for desktop browsers.

The Elastic skin is built with LESS and of course the sources are included.
They allow a certain degree of customization by adjusting some color [variables](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/blob/master/skins/elastic/styles/colors.less).
All you need is to compile your very own customized skin with `lessc`.

See the full changelog in the [release notes](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.4-beta)
on the Github download page.

This is a beta release and we recommend to test it on a separate environment.
And don't forget to backup your data before installing it.
Download it from [roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download).
