We proudly announce the second service release to update the stable version 1.3.
It contains fixes to several bugs reported by our dear community members
as well as translation updates synchronized from [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/roundcube/roundcube-webmail/).

We also changed the wording for the setting that controls the time after which
an opened message is marked as read. This was previously only affecting messages
being viewed in the preview panel but now applies to all means of opening
a message. That change came with 1.3.0 an apparently confused many users.
Some translation work is still needed here.

See the full changelog in the [release notes](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.3.2)
on the Github download page.

This release is considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations 
of Roundcube with this version. Download it from [roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download).

Please do backup your data before updating!
