We just published the first service release to update the stable version 1.2. It contains 
some important bug fixes and improvements in the recently introduced Enigma plugin 
for PGP encryption. See the detailed changelog in [here](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Changelog#release-121).

This release is considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations 
of Roundcube with this version. Download it from [roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download).
