This is the first service release to update the stable version 1.0. It contains
some important bug fixes and improvements, mainly a fix for the unintentional
redirect from the compose page in Google Chrome which started to happen after
a recent Chrome update.

It's considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations
of Roundcube with this version. Download it from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download),
see the full changelog [here](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog).

Please note that the update includes a small database schema change so make sure 
you run the update script.
