After the big new features in 0.4-beta this release now completes the unfinished work and fixes bugs related to the new threaded message listing and address groups features. We also cleaned up the user interface and tried to make all UI elements more consistent.

With this release the skins have been excluded from the GPL license terms (see README file). This allows you to choose whatever license you want for your custom skins and even opens the door for creating commercial skins.

We recommend to update all existing Roundcube installations with this release. Get it from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download)
