Today we can announce another service release of the Roundcube webmail package. This update adds small bug fixes and improvements to the 0.8 stable series. It also fixes a possible, although unintended, DoS to the webserver running Roundcube. See the included CHANGELOG file for details.

We consider it stable and we recommend to update all existing Roundcube installation with this release. Download it from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download)
