We proudly announce the third service release for the stable 0.9 series of 
Roundcube webmail. It fixes 25 more bugs including two recently reposted XSS 
vulnerabilities with HTML messages and signatures. Along with that, we also 
optimized the UI behavior for touch devices to make Roundcube work nice and 
smoothly on tablets running iOS or Android.

It's considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations 
of Roundcube with this version. Download it from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download), 
see the full changelog [here](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog).
