We just published the first service release to update the stable version 1.3 
which is the result of some touching-up on the new features introduced with the
1.3.0 release. For example it brings back the double-click behavior to open messages
which was reduced to the list-only view. Or because the switch to change the mail view
layout was a bit hidden, we also added it to the preferences section.

The update also includes fixes to reported bugs and one potential XSS vulnerability 
as well as optimizations to smoothly run on the latest version of PHP.

See the full changelog in the [release notes](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.3.1)
on the Github download page.

This release is considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations 
of Roundcube with this version. Download it from [roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download).
