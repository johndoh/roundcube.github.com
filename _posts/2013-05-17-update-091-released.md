We proudly announce the first service release for the 0.9 series of Roundcube. As usual, it contains

some bug fixes and improvements which didn't make it into the first stable version as well as some translation updates. After getting reports that some skin images weren't reloaded due to progressive cache settings, the packaged version now comes with unique urls of skin images referenced by templates and CSS files.

It's considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations of Roundcube with this version. Download it from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download), see the full changelog [here](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog).
