We proudly announce a new service release to update the stable version 1.3.
It contains fixes to several bugs backported from the master branch. One can be
called a minor security fix as it fixes blocking of remote content on specially 
crafted style tags.

See the full changelog in the [release notes](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.3.5)
on the Github download page.

This release is considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations 
of Roundcube with this version. Download it from [roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download).

Please do backup your data before updating!
