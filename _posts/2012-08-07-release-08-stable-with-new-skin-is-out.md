We're proud to finally release version 0.8 with the brand new skin, codename "Larry", becoming the new default UI for Roundcube. After two preview releases and a lot of fine-tuning, the new design by bueroflint.com has now grown up. But to all nostalgics out there: don't worry, the old skin still remains part of the package and will be maintained for at least one more major release.

Beside the new UI, this version also contains more bugfixes and improvements (see CHANGELOG) as well as some code refactorings. Another major change since the last stable release is the updated license which is now GPL v3+ with exceptions for skin & plugins. Read more about that on [roundcube.net/license](https://roundcube.net/license)

After lots of testing and collecting your feedback, this version is considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations of Roundcube. Get the new version from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download)
