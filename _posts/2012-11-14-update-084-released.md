We just published new packages for Roundcube webmail. This service update mainly fixes a nasty bug which sneaked into the last 0.8.3 release. In addition to that, we also packed some more fixes into this release, one of them a recently reported XSS vulnerability.

If you installed 0.8.3, please immediately update your installation with this new version. The buggy previous version makes the compose screen to randomly reload itself which may result in a loss of the unsent message.
