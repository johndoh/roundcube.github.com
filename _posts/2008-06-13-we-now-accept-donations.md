After getting several requests about donations for our project we decided to open a PayPal account for this purpose. But donations to RoundCube Webmail will be passed to charity projects, mainly the KANTHA BOPHA Children's Hospital in Cambodia. 

Nevertheless your donations show us your appreciation and this motivates our devs to keep up the development.

Got to [roundcube.net/donation](https://roundcube.net/donation) for more details.
