title: Roundcube License Change to GPLv3
date: 2012-02-22 09:37:39Z

Starting with the upcoming version 0.8, Roundcube will be licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3 or later (with exceptions for skins & plugins) while it was licensed under GPL (v2) before that change.

Together with the change to GPLv3+ we also added an exception paragraph to the Roundcube license agreement which explicitly excludes skins & plugins from the terms of the GPL. This shall give a maximum flexibility to skin designers and plugin developers to choose any other license for their work or even to create commercial or proprietary components.

More details about the new license, the exception and background of this change can be found here: [roundcube.net/license](https://roundcube.net/license)
