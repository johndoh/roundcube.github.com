We're happy to announce that a new major release of Roundcube is now available for testing. As usual it contains many bugfixes (thanks to all the reporters and contributers) and brings more stability and speedup as well as some new features such as Internationalized Domain Name (IDNA) support, support for shared/global IMAP folders and support for SMTP Delivery Status Notifications. Plus some minor changes to the message list UI and many improvements under the hood.

Download the 0.5-beta release now from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download) and test it in your local environments. Any bug reports and suggestions for improvements are welcome.
