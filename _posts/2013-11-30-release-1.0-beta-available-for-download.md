We're proud to announce that the long awaited version 1.0 of Roundcube webmail 
is now available as *beta* release for download and testing. With this milestone 
we introduce some important changes to the configuration as well as some nice 
new features:

* Cleaned up the configuration into a single file
* Importing email messages and contact group assignments
* Advanced LDAP address book functionality
* A toggle to switch between HTML and plaintext view
* Save drafts in local storage for recovery
* Canned responses to save and recall boilerplate texts
* Improved keyboard navigation in messages list
* Attachment reminder plugin

And of course plenty of small improvements and bug fixes.

**WARNING**: the old configuration files named `main.inc.php` and `db.inc.php` 
are now deprecated and should be replaced with one single `config.inc.php` file.
Run the `./bin/update.sh` script to get this conversion done or manually merge 
the files. *NOTE*: the new `config.inc.php` should only contain options that  differ from the ones listed in `defaults.inc.php`.

See the complete Changelog at [trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog)  and download the new packages from  [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download). Please note that this  is a beta release and we recommend to test it on a separate environment.
