After another round of bugfixing we're happy to announce the stable release of Roundcube webmail version 0.7. Beside fixing bugs we added some security improvements which will protect the Roundcube users from XSS and clickjacking attacks.

With this release Roundcube also passes the email standards project's acid test. See [www.email-standards.org/acid-test](http://www.email-standards.org/acid-test)

We recommend to update all existing Roundcube installations with this version. Get it now from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download) and have fun!
