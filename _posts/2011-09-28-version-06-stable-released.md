The next major release has finally reached stable state and is now available for download. The most important improvement since the 0.5 line is certainly the full-featured address book which now provides a smart interface to manage rich contact information including photos. A brief description of all new features was posted here: [lists.roundcube.net/mail-archive/announce/2011-08/0000002.html](http://lists.roundcube.net/mail-archive/announce/2011-08/0000002.html)

And last but not least, this version also contains some improvements and fixes which make Roundcube look good on the just released Firefox 7.

We recommend to update all existing Roundcube installations with this version. Get it now from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download) and have fun!
